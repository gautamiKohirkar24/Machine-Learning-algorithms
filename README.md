# Machine-Learning-algorithms
In this repository my aim is to add all of my learnings from machine learning. Here i am going to showcase all the machine learning algorithm implementation and the accuracy obtained in the model.
\begin{itemize}The Algorithms that have been covered -
    \item 1.Linear Regression
    \item 2.Logistic Regression
    \item 3.Regularization
    \item 4.Gradient Descent
    \item 5.PCA
    \item 6.KNN
    \item 7.K-means Clustering
    \item 8.Decision Trees
    
\end{itemize}
