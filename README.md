# Machine-Learning-algorithms
In this repository my aim is to add all of my learnings from machine learning. Here i am going to showcase all the machine learning algorithm implementation and the accuracy obtained in the model.
The Algorithms that have been covered -
    1.Linear Regression
    2.Logistic Regression
    3.Regularization
    4.Gradient Descent
    5.PCA
    6.KNN
    7.K-means Clustering
    8.Decision Trees
