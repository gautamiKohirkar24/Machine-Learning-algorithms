## Machine-Learning-algorithms
In this repository my aim is to add all of my learnings from machine learning. Here, I am going to showcase all the machine learning algorithm implementation and the accuracy obtained in the model.

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Regularization**
4. **Gradient Descent**
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
7. **K-means Clustering**
8. **Decision Trees**
